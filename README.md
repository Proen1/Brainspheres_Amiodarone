# Brainspheres_Amiodarone
This repository describes the model of in vitro kinetics of amiodarone in a repeated exposure assay with human iPSC-based Brainspheres.
The model was used and descrbed in the paper : "Integrating distribution kinetics and toxicodynamics to assess repeat dose neurotoxicity in vitro using human BrainSpheres: A case study on amiodarone".
Its consists in compartmental model which rates were fit to experimental data of amiodarone in the medium, plastic and cells in time.
The repository consists  of:
1- file with the model and experimental data of quantity of amiodarone measured in the different compartments
2-fie with the error function and optimization routine
3-Rmarkdown for ploting the models simulations with fit parameters against experimental data
4-file to calculate the Cmax and AUC for all the doses used experimentally to make the dose-response curves
